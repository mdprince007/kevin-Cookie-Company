##  Project Insights

Sales show seasonal patterns, with clear monthly peaks.

Certain cookie types are consistently more profitable than others.

Top-performing countries contribute a major share of overall profit.

Units sold and profit do not always scale equally — highlighting cost differences between products.



---

##  Final Conclusion

To maximize growth:

Focus on high-margin cookies in top-performing countries.

Use seasonal promotions to boost sales in peak months.

Monitor country-cookie combinations to optimize pricing and supply chain.
